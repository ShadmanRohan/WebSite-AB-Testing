A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a method of comparing two different versions of a web page, app, or marketing campaign to determine which one performs better in terms of user engagement, conversion rates, or other key performance indicators.

The basic process of A/B testing involves creating two variants of a web page, app, or marketing campaign, where only one element is different between the two versions. This could be a different headline, a different image, or a different call-to-action button, for example. The two versions are then randomly presented to users, and their behavior and interactions with each version are tracked and analyzed to determine which version performs better.

With A/B tests, many features such as being a member of a site, clicking, clicking on advertisements, going to a sale can be tested. In the dataset here, we will observe whether a change made in the web interface of a market increases the number of clicks.
